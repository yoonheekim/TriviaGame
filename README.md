1. About
    * You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
    * If the player selects the correct answer, it shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it will automatically display the next question.
    * The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
        * If the player runs out of time, the game will tell the player that their time's up and display the correct answer. After a few seconds, it will automatically show the next question.
        * If the player chooses the wrong answer, it will tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. After a few seconds, it will automatically show the next question.
    * On the final screen, it will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
